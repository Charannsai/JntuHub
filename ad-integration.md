# Ad Integration Notes

The AdDisplay component has been simplified to prevent layout interference:

1. Removed all custom styling from the ad container
2. Using only the necessary AdSense markup
3. Letting the AdSense script handle responsive behavior

For proper mobile navigation:
1. Mobile menu overlay has z-index: 9999
2. Mobile menu itself has z-index: 10000
3. This ensures the menu appears above all content including ads

These changes maintain the integrity of both the navigation and ad display without them interfering with each other.
